def dft2(f, alpha, shape=None, shift=(0, 0), offset=(0, 0), unitary=True, out=None):
    r"""Compute the 2-dimensional discrete Fourier Transform.

    The DFT is defined in one dimension as

    .. math::

        A_k = \sum_{m=0}^{n-1} a_n \exp \left(-2\pi i\frac{mk}{n}\right) \hspace{3em} k=0, \dots, n-1

    This function allows independent control over input shape, output shape,
    and output sampling by implementing the matrix triple product algorithm
    described in [1].

    Parameters
    ----------
    f : array_like
        2D array to Fourier Transform
    alpha : float or array_like
        Output plane sampling interval (frequency). If :attr:`alpha` is an
        array, ``alpha[1]`` represents row-wise sampling and ``alpha[2]``
        represents column-wise sampling. If :attr:`alpha` is a scalar,
        ``alpha[1] = alpha[2] = alpha`` gives uniform sampling across the rows
        and columns of the output plane.
    shape : int or array_like, optional
        Size of the output array :attr:`F`. If :attr:`shape` is an array,
        ``F.shape = (shape[0], shape[1])``. If :attr:`shape`` is a scalar,
        ``F.shape = (shape, shape)``. Default is ``f.shape``.
    shift : array_like, optional
        Number of pixels in (r,c) to shift the DC pixel in the output plane
        with the origin centrally located in the plane. Default is ``(0,0)``.
    offset : array_like, optional
        Number of pixels in (r,c) that the input plane is shifted relative to
        the origin. Default is ``(0,0)``.
    unitary : bool, optional
        Normalization flag. If ``True``, a normalization is performed on the
        output such that the DFT operation is unitary and energy is conserved
        through the Fourier transform operation (Parseval's theorem). In this
        way, the energy in in a limited-area DFT is a fraction of the total
        energy corresponding to the limited area. Default is ``True``.
    out : ndarray or None
        A location into which the result is stored. If provided, out.shape ==
        shape and out.dtype == np.complex. If not provided or None, a
        freshly-allocated array is returned.

    Returns
    -------
    F : complex ndarray

    Notes
    -----
    * Setting ``alpha = 1/f.shape`` and ``shape = f.shape`` is equivalent to

      ::

          F = np.fft.ifftshift(np.fft.fft2(np.fft.fftshift(f)))

    * ``dft2()`` is designed to place the DC pixel in the same location as a
      well formed call to any standard FFT for both even and odd sized input
      arrays. The DC pixel is located at ``np.floor(shape/2) + 1``, which is
      consistent with calls to Numpy's FFT method where the input and output
      are correctly shifted:
      ``np.fft.ifftshift(np.fft.fft2(np.fft.fftshift(f)))``.

    * If the y-axis shift behavior is not what you are expecting, you most
      likely have your plotting axes flipped (matplotlib's default behavior is
      to place [0,0] in the upper left corner of the axes). This may be resolved
      by either flipping the sign of the y component of ``shift`` or by passing
      ``origin = 'lower'`` to ``imshow()``.
