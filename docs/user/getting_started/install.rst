Installation

If you are new to Python and/or do not have familiarity with `Python virtual
environments <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html>`_, then we 
recommend starting by installing the `Anaconda Distribution
<https://www.anaconda.com/download/>`_. This works on all platforms (Linux,
MacOS, Windows) and installs a full-featured scientific Python in a user 
directory without requiring root permissions.
