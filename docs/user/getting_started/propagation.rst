Optical propagation
*******************

Most optical systems can be adequately modeled by a single far-field propagation
between a :ref:`user.planes.pupil` and image plane. This includes most cameras,
telescopes, and imaging instruments. In these models, all of the optics in a system are
represented by a single |Pupil| plane:
