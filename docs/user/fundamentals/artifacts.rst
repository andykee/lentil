    To ensure accuracy and avoid introducing ailiasing artifacts, the input data should
    be at least Nyquist sampled when applying imaging artifacts via convolution.

Smear
-----
Smear is used to represent image motion with a relatively low temporal frequency relative
to integration time. The motion occurs in a slowly varying or fixed direction over one
integration time. Lentil's :func:`smear` method represents smear as a linear
directional blur over some distance (or number of pixels):

.. code:: pycon

    >>> import lentil
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> psf = ...  # PSF calculation details omitted
    >>> psf_smear = lentil.smear(psf, distance=5e-5,
    ...                          pixelscale=5e-6,
    ...                          oversample=5)
    >>> plt.subplot(121), plt.imshow(psf, cmap='inferno')
    >>> plt.subplot(122), plt.imshow(psf_smear, cmap='inferno')

.. plot:: _img/python/smear.py
    :scale: 50

As an alternative to specifying physical distance and pixelscale, a number of pixels can also
be provided:

.. code:: pycon

    >>> import lentil
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> psf = ...  # PSF calculation details omitted
    >>> psf_smear = lentil.smear(psf, distance=10,
    ...                          oversample=5)
    >>> plt.subplot(121), plt.imshow(psf, cmap='inferno')
    >>> plt.subplot(122), plt.imshow(psf_smear, cmap='inferno')

.. plot:: _img/python/smear.py
    :scale: 50

The default behavior is to choose a new random smear direction each time :func:`smear`
is called, but a static direction can optionally be specified as needed:

.. code:: pycon

    >>> import lentil
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> psf = ...  # PSF calculation details omitted
    >>> psf_smear = lentil.smear(psf, distance=25,
    ...                          angle=30)
    >>> plt.subplot(121), plt.imshow(psf, cmap='inferno')
    >>> plt.subplot(122), plt.imshow(psf_smear, cmap='inferno')

.. plot:: _img/python/smear_directional.py
    :scale: 50

Jitter
------
Jitter is used to represent image motion with a relatively high temporal frequency relative
to integration time. Lentil's :func:`jitter` method represents jitter with a
Gaussian blur operation. Note this approach is only valid if the motion occurs randomly in all
directions during one integration time.

.. code:: pycon

    >>> import lentil
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> psf = ...  # PSF calculation details omitted
    >>> psf_jitter = lentil.jitter(psf, scale=2, oversample=5)
    >>> plt.subplot(121), plt.imshow(psf, cmap='inferno')
    >>> plt.subplot(122), plt.imshow(psf_jitter, cmap='inferno')

.. plot:: _img/python/jitter.py
    :scale: 50

If the jitter being modeled is not sufficiently random during a typical integration time, a
timeseries should be used instead. This can have a major impact on propagation performance
but will provide the most accurate results.
