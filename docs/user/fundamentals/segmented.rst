Segmented optical systems
*************************

Creating a model of a segmented aperture optical system in Lentil doesn't 
require any special treatment. The |Plane| object works the same with sparse 
or segmented amplitude, opd, and mask attributes as with monolithic ones.

When working with a segmented aperture, it can be advantageous from a 
performance point of view to supply a 3-dimensional `segment mask` when 
specifying a Plane's :attr:`~lentil.Plane.mask` attribute rather than a 
flattened 2-dimensional `global mask` , as depicted below:

    :scale: 50

This modification is not necessary to achieve accurate propagations, but can
greatly improve performance. Since a wavefront is monochromatic, it can be 
broken into any arbitrary number of fields and recombined coherently at a 
later time.
