****************************
Representing wavefront error
****************************

Wavefront error is represented in a :class:`~lentil.Plane` by specifying its
:attr:`~lentil.Plane.opd` attribute. For static errors, a simple wavefront error map is
sufficient. For more complicated errors that are random or time-varying in nature, a
more dynamic and/or state-based approach is required.

Any Python type that is array-like can be provided and will be converted by
Lentil to a Numpy array.

.. note::

    For :class:`~lentil.Pupil` planes, the :attr:`~lentil.Pupil.opd` attribute represents 
    the optical path difference (OPD) relative to the pupil's reference sphere.

.. _user.wavefront_error.sign:

Wavefront error sign convention
===============================
For the purposes of representing wavefront errors, Lentil assumes that a
positive OPD is indicative of a ray traveling farther than the chief ray,
while a negative ray travels a shorter distance than the chief ray.

Tip/tilt
--------
A positive x-tilt rotates the yz plane clockwise about the x-axis resulting
in a shift in the image plane in the positive y direction. A positive y-tilt
rotates the xz plane clockwise about the y-axis resulting in a shift in the
image plane in the negative x direction.

.. plot:: user/fundamentals/plots/tilt_images.py
    :scale: 50

Focus
-----
A positive focus has the effect of shifting the focus point beyond the image plane (+z)
while a negative focus has the effect of shifting the focus point in front of the image
plane (-z).

.. image:: /_static/img/focus_direction.png
    :width: 450px
    :align: center

We can test this by observing +/- defocused point spread functions of an
imaging system with an asymmetric aperture (for example, in the shape of the letter
P). We expect the positive focus image to have the same orientation as the aperture
(consistent with observing the image before coming to focus) and the negative focus
image to be flipped about both axes relative to the aperture (consistent with
observing the image after passing through focus). The results of this exercise are
presented below:

.. plot:: user/fundamentals/plots/focus_images.py
    :scale: 50

Static Errors
=============
Lentil can use static error maps from a multitude of formats, provided you can get the
data into Python. Common file formats are .npy or .fits files. Here we load an .npy file
containing the JWST NITCam static wavefront error:

.. NIRCam pixelscale is 0.031 arcsec/px = 1.5029E-7 rad/px
.. rad = arcsec * (2*pi)/1296000
.. IFOV = 2*arctan(d/(2*f))
.. f = 18e-6/(2*np.tan(0.5*1.5029e-7))

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import lentil
    >>> opd = np.load('path/to/nircam_wfe.npy')
    >>> pupil = lentil.Pupil(focal_length=119.77, pixelscale=6.6035/1024, opd=opd)

.. image:: /_static/img/nircam.png
    :scale: 50
    :align: center

Zernike Polynomials
===================
Lentil provides methods for creating, combining, fitting, and removing `Zernike
polynomials <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zernike_polynomials>`_.

.. note::

    Lentil uses the Noll indexing scheme for defining Zernike polynomials [1]_.

Wavefront error maps are easily computed using either the :func:`~lentil.zernike` or
:func:`~lentil.zernike_compose` functions. For example, we can represent 100 nm of 
astigmatism over a circular aperture with :func:`~lentil.zernike`:

.. plot::
    :include-source:
    :scale: 50

    >>> mask = lentil.circlemask((256,256), 120)
    >>> astig = 100e-9 * lentil.zernike(mask, index=6)
    >>> plt.imshow(astig, origin='lower')


Any arbitrary combination of Zernike polynomials can be represented by providing a 
list of coefficients to the :func:`~lentil.zernike_compose` function:

.. plot::
    :include-source:
    :scale: 50

    >>> mask = lentil.circlemask((256,256), 120)
    >>> coeff = np.random.uniform(low=-200e-9, high=200e-9, size=10)
    >>> z = lentil.zernike_compose(mask, coeff)
    >>> plt.imshow(z, origin='lower')

Note that the coefficients list is ordered according to the `Noll indexing scheme
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zernike_polynomials#Zernike_polynomials>`_ so the
first entry in the list represents piston, the second represents, tilt, and so on.

For models requiring many random trials, it may make more sense to pre-compute the
Zernike modes once and accumulate the error map for each new state. We can do this by
creating a vectorized basis set using :func:`~lentil.zernike_basis` and accumulating
each independent term using Numpy's `einsum
<https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.einsum.html>`_ function.

Note that in this case we are only computing the Zernike modes we intend to use (Noll
indices 4 and 6) so now the first entry in ``coeff`` corresponds to focus and the
second corresponds to astigmatism.

.. plot::
    :include-source:
    :scale: 50

    >>> mask = lentil.circlemask((256,256), 120)
    >>> coeff = [200e-9, -100e-9]
    >>> basis = lentil.zernike_basis(mask, modes=(4,6))
    >>> z = np.einsum('ijk,i->jk', basis, coeff)
    >>> plt.imshow(z, origin='lower')

It's also possible to achieve the same result using Numpy's
`tensordot <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.tensordot.html>`_:

.. plot::
    :include-source:
    :scale: 50

    >>> mask = lentil.circlemask((256,256), 120)
    >>> coeff = [200e-9, -100e-9]
    >>> basis = lentil.zernike_basis(mask, modes=(4,6))
    >>> z = np.tensordot(basis, coeff, axes=(0,0))
    >>> plt.imshow(z, origin='lower')

Normalization
-------------
Each of Lentil's Zernike functions accepts a ``normalize`` parameter. If ``normalize``
is False (the default), the raw Zernike mode is returned. Each mode will approximately
span [-1 1] although this shouldn't be relied upon because of the discrete sampling of
the result. If ``normalize`` is true, the Zernike mode will be normalized so that its
standard deviation equals 1.

Normalization becomes important when trying to achieve a specific error magnitude,
whether it be in terms of RMS or peak to valley. To acihieve a specific error in terms
of RMS, Zernike modes should be computed with ``normalize=True`` before multiplying by
the error magnitude:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> mask = lentil.circlemask((256,256), 128)
    >>> z4 = 100e-9 * lentil.zernike(mask, mode=4, normalize=True)
    >>> np.std(z4[np.nonzero(z4)])

    9.986295346152438e-08

To achieve a specific error in terms of peak to valley, Zernike modes should be computed
and normalized separately. The separate normalization step should be performed to ensure
the discretely sampled mode spans [-0.5 0.5] before multiplying by the error magnitude:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> mask = lentil.circlemask((256,256), 128)
    >>> z4 = lentil.zernike(mask, mode=4)
    >>> z4 /= np.max(z4) - np.min(z4)
    >>> z4 *= 100e-9
    >>> np.max(z4) - np.min(z4)

    1e-07

Defining custom Zernike coordinates
-----------------------------------
By default, all of Lentil's Zernike functions place the center of the coordinate system
at the centroid of the supplied mask with its axes aligned with Lentil's
:ref:`user.fundamentals.coordinates`. This works as expected for the vast majority of
needs, but in some cases it may be desirable to manually define the coordinate system.
This is accomplished by using :func:`~lentil.zernike_coordinates` to compute ``rho`` and
``theta``, and providing these definitions to the appropriate Zernike function. For
example, if we have an off-centered sub-aperture but wish to compute focus relative to
the center of the defined array:

.. plot::
    :include-source:
    :scale: 50

    >>> mask = lentil.circlemask((256,256), radius=50, shift=(0,60))
    >>> rho, theta = lentil.zernike_coordinates(mask, shift=(0,60))
    >>> z4 = lentil.zernike(mask, 4, rho=rho, theta=theta)
    >>> plt.imshow(z4, origin='lower')

If we wish to align a tilt mode with one side of a hexagon:

.. plot::
    :include-source:
    :scale: 50

    >>> mask = lentil.hexagon((256,256), radius=120)
    >>> rho, theta = lentil.zernike_coordinates(mask, shift=(0,0), rotate=30)
    >>> z2 = lentil.zernike(mask, 2, rho=rho, theta=theta)
    >>> plt.imshow(z2, origin='lower')

Wavefront Influence Functions
=============================
The effects of optical element rigid body perturbations as represented in the
exit pupil of an optical system are commonly captured using linearized wavefront
influence functions (also called wavefront sensitivity matrices). These
linearized models can be used in place of a full ray-tracing model for
representing small perturbations and errors. In general, a linear wavefront error
model has the form:

.. math::

    \mathbf{\theta} = \mathbf{S}\Delta\mathbf{x}

where :math:`\mathbf{\theta}` is the wavefront error map, :math:`S` is the sensitivity
matrix, and :math:`\Delta\mathbf{x}` is a vector of perturbations relative to the system
state about which linearization occurred.

The :math:`\mathbf{S}` matrix will have either two or three dimensions. For a three-
dimensional sensitivity matrix, the wavefront error map is computed by multiplying
:math:`\mathbf{S}`  by the :math:`\Delta\mathbf{x}` vector and summing along the first
dimension:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> theta = np.einsum('ijk,i->jk', S, dx)

For a two-dimensional sensitivity matrix, each mode is assumed to have been unraveled
into a vector. The wavefront error is computed by taking the dot product of
:math:`\mathbf{S}` and :math:`\Delta\mathbf{x}` and reshaping the resulting vector into a
two-dimensional error map. For a sensitivity matrix representing a 256 x 256 pixel
wavefront map:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> theta = np.dot(S, dx)
    >>> theta.reshape((256,256))

Surface roughness
=================
Random optical surface errors that result from the manufacturing and figuring process
are typically small in magnitude and are commonly expressed through their power
spectral density (PSD). The :func:`~lentil.power_spectrum` function computes random
wavefront error map given a PSD:

.. plot::
    :include-source:
    :scale: 50

    >>> mask = lentil.circle((256, 256), 120)
    >>> w = lentil.power_spectrum(mask, pixelscale=1/120, rms=25e-9, 
    ...                           half_power_freq=8, exp=3)
    >>> plt.imshow(w, origin='lower')


.. Chromatic Aberrations
.. =====================
.. Chromatic aberrations are wavelength-dependent errors cause by dispersion. These
.. aberrations can be further classified as either transverse or longitudinal. Transverse
.. chromatic aberration causes a wavelength-dependent focus shift and can be implemented
.. by customizing :class:`~lentil.DispersivePhase`'s :func:`~lentil.DispersivePhase.multiply`
.. method. For example, if an
.. optical system produces best focus at 550 nm and each nm of wavelength change causes 1 nm
.. of focus error, we represent the wavelength-dependent focus by:

.. .. math::

..     \mbox{Focus shift} = \lambda - 550 \times 10^{-9}

.. We implement this focus shift as an additional focus :attr:`~lentil.Plane.phase` term
.. that is applied within the plane's :func:`~lentil.Plane._phasor` method. Note that
.. wavelength is given in :attr:`Wavefront.wavelength`

.. .. code-block:: python3

..     import lentil as le

..     class TransverseCA(le.Plane):

..         def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
..             super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

..             # Pre-compute defocus map for efficiency
..            self.defocus = le.zernike.zernike(mask=self.amplitude,
..                                               index=4,
..                                               normalize=True)

..         def _phasor(amplitude, ):


.. Transverse chromatic aberration causes a wavelength-dependent magnification across the
.. field.
