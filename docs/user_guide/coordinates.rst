Lentil adopts the widely used convention of aligning the z-axis along the direction
of light propagation through an optical system. By the right hand rule, it follows that
the remaining axes are oriented as shown in the figure below:

When viewing a plane in 2D, the z-axis comes out of the screen with the
positive x-axis pointing to the right and the positive y-axis pointing up.

Lentil also adopts the right hand rule convention for rotations about the coordinate
system defined above:

* Rotations in +x rotate the yz plane counter-clockwise about the x-axis
* Rotations in +y rotate the xz plane counter-clockwise about the y-axis
* Rotations in +z rotate the xy plane counter-clockwise about the z-axis

    :scale: 50

.. note::

    Matplotlib's ``imshow()`` method (and MATLAB's ``imagesc()`` method) place
    the origin in the upper left corner of the plotted image by default. This presents
    arrays in the standard (row, column) ordering. The result is that the direction of
    y-axis is flipped relative to Lentil's coordinate system. This doesn't necessarily
    present a problem as long as results are consistently plotted "incorrectly", but
    to be completely correct (particularly when comparing model-generated images against
    intuition or measured data) the origin should be located in the lower left corner
    of the displayed image.
