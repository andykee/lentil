User Guide
**********

The User Guide provides documentation for all of Lentil's features and capabilities. It
is generally organized by topic area.

Brand new users should start with the :ref:`package-overview` and :ref:`tutorial`.

Detailed information on any specific class or method can be found in the :ref:`api`.

.. note::
    Many of the topics covered in this user guide and the API reference require some
    understanding of the underlying physics that govern the processes modeled
    by Lentil.

    This documentation does not attempt to provide a comprehensive reference to these
    topics but does provide links and references to supporting materials where
    applicable.
