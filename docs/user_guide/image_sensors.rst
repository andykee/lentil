Lentil does not provide an end-to-end detector modeling capability, but instead provides
a :ref:`collection of functions<api-detector>` to help model image sensors and
represent some of the more commonly encountered noise sources.

Basic Signal Flow
=================
An image sensor converts photons striking a pixel into a digital signal. The signal
produced by each pixel is subject to a number of physical characteristics and is
degraded by a variety of noise sources. The core components of this process are
represented in the figure below:

Photons striking a pixel during an integration time will result in the accumulation of
electrons in the pixel well. The fraction of photons striking a pixel that are collected
as electrons is the sensor's *quantum efficiency* (QE). Additional electrons "leaking"
into each pixel are represented as *dark signal*. The electrons collected in each pixel
during an integration time are converted to a voltage (up to some saturation point),
amplified, and converted to a digital signal by an ADC. Additional noise generated
during the readout and conversion of the analog signal is represented as *read noise*.

This is a somewhat simplistic model of a digital image sensor but it provides the
framework for capturing the majority of physical effects and noise sources present and
is easily extended to capture more complex and nuanced effects.

Noise
=====

* Shot noise due to randomness in the arrival and detection of photons
* The conversion of photons into electrons (quantum efficiency)
* Dark current due to thermally generated electrons inside each pixel
* Spatial nonuniformity due to variations in detector pixels and electronics
* Noise generated by the electronics which read out the pixel values
* Pixel defects like hot or dead pixels, and other imaging artifacts like cosmic ray
  strikes


The signal can be split into two primary groups:

* A light signal representing the irrandiance (photons/s/px) presented to the detector.
  Note that the light signal represents **all** sources of photon flux which may include
  near field (self-emission) contributions in addition to the scene being observed.
* A dark signal representing all other sources of electrons present in the detector that
  aren't due to the light signal. These sources include thermally generated dark current
  and any voltage offsets.

Various noise sources also contribute to the eventual digital signal read out by the
detector. These noise sources can be broadly classified into two groups:

* Fixed-pattern noise is time-invariant and does not change from frame to frame. Fixed
  pattern noise can be thought of as a characteristic of the detector
* Temporal noise varies from frame to frame and typically represents random processes in t
  he detection and readout of an image
