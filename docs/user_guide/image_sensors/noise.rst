Noise
*****

* Shot noise due to randomness in the arrival and detection of photons
* The conversion of photons into electrons (quantum efficiency)
* Dark current due to thermally generated electrons inside each pixel
* Spatial nonuniformity due to variations in detector pixels and electronics
* Noise generated by the electronics which read out the pixel values
* Pixel defects like hot or dead pixels, and other imaging artifacts like cosmic ray
  strikes


The signal can be split into two primary groups:

* A light signal representing the irrandiance (photons/s/px) presented to the detector.
  Note that the light signal represents **all** sources of photon flux which may include
  near field (self-emission) contributions in addition to the scene being observed.
* A dark signal representing all other sources of electrons present in the detector that
  aren't due to the light signal. These sources include thermally generated dark current
  and any voltage offsets.

Various noise sources also contribute to the eventual digital signal read out by the
detector. These noise sources can be broadly classified into two groups:

* Fixed-pattern noise is time-invariant and does not change from frame to frame. Fixed
  pattern noise can be thought of as a characteristic of the detector
* Temporal noise varies from frame to frame and typically represents random processes in t
  he detection and readout of an image
