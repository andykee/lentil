Lentil is a Python library for modeling the imaging chain of an optical system.
It was originally developed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab by the Wavefront Sensing and
Control group (383E) to provide an easy to use framework for simulating point spread
functions of segmented aperture telescopes.

.. card:: :octicon:`info;1em;` Note

    Lentil is under active development and new features continue to be added. 
    Until Lentil reaches version 1.0, the API is not guaranteed to be stable, but
    changes breaking backwards compatibility will be noted in the 
    :ref:`release notes <release>`.
