Lentil is a Python library for modeling the imaging chain of an optical system.
It was originally developed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab by the Wavefront Sensing and
Control group (383E) to provide an easy to use framework for simulating point spread
functions of segmented aperture telescopes.

.. note::

    Lentil is still under active development and new features continue to be added.
    Until Lentil reaches version 1.0, the API is not guaranteed to be stable, but
    changes breaking backwards compatibility will be noted in the 
    :doc:`release notes <release>`.

        modules, and objects included in NumPy. The reference describes how the
        methods work and which parameters can be used. It assumes that you have an
        understanding of the key concepts.
