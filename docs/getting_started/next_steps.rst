* Modeling Diffraction
* Model Patterns



The :ref:`api` provides a detailed description of the Lentil API syntax. It gives
specifics on how to use Lentil's classes and functions (parameter names and types,
method names and returns, etc.) This reference documentation assumes a general
understanding of how to use Lentil.

The :ref:`development` guide gives information on working with Lentil's source code and
contributing to the library. It also has a section on :ref:`technical-notes` which
provides in-depth discussion of the technical implementation of some of Lentil's more
complicated or novel features.
