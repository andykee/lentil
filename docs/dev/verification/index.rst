Algorithm Verification
**********************

Lentil contains a large unit test suite that verifies the software is behaving
as expected. A majority of these tests verify interfaces and behavioral 
patterns, although a few verify the correctness of Lentil's numerical models
of real world physics phenomena. Verification notes for these algorithms are
given here.
