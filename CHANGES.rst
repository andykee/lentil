Changes
=======

v0.2.0
------
Released June 29, 2020

* Collapse ``Detector`` and ``Image`` planes into single ``Image`` plane. The pupil to
  image plane propagation method is now chosen based on whether the ``Image`` plane has
  a defined ``pixelscale`` (propagate via matrix triple product DFT) or if
  ``pixelscale`` is None (propagate via FFT - eventually). ``Detector`` class has been
  deprecated. `#5`_
* Deprecate ``FPA`` and ``BayerFPA``. Some functionality has been retained but converted
  to atomic functions in the :ref:`detector<api-detector>` module. `#6`_
* Completely rework the contents of the :ref:`detector<api-detector>` module. All
  objects have been deprecated. Some functionality has been retained but converted to
  atomic functions instead. `#6`_
* Deprecate ``util.coordinates`
* Change the way ``Rotate`` angle is interpreted to behave more intuitively
* A number of small bugfixes and enhancements
* Updated documentation
* More unit tests
