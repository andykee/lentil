v0.5.0
------
Released August 13, 2021

* Propagations with ``tilt='angle'`` have tilt projected out of each
  plane once before the entire propagation rather than at each monochromatic
  propagation
* Rework ``Plane.pixelscale`` to always store (r,c) pixelscale
* Fix bug in ``Plane.mask`` on the fly calculation that was overwriting
  ``Plane.amplitude`` with a binary mask
* No longer cache ``Plane.ptt_vector``
* Deprecate ``Plane.cache_propagate()`` and ``Plane.clear_cache_propagate()``.
  This functionality has been migrated to ``propagate._prepare_planes()``
  and ``propagate._cleanup_planes()``
* New ``Plane.rescale()`` method to rescale Plane pixelscale
* Update ``util.rescale()`` to choose a more conservative (better sampled)
  result when having to choose an integer output shape
* Define ``Wavefront.__slots__`` to increase attribute access speed and reduce
  memory footprint

* Deprecate ``cache.Cache`` in favor of a simple dictionary
* New function ``fourier.expc()`` to more quickly compute a complex exponential
* ``fourier.dft2()`` now accepts an offset parameter
* New function ``Plane.fit_tilt()`` to handle tilt fitting and removal of in the
  Plane's ``phase`` attribute. This is now called once
* New function ``Plane.slice()`` for computing avaliable slices from the plane
  attributes to speed up propagation performance
* New ``Detector()`` plane that returns intensity
* Update ``zernike.zernike_coordinates()`` to automatically compute shift that
  locates the origin at the mask centroid if no shift is provided.

v0.4.1
------
Released October 7, 2020

  The Grism model updates are broken in this release. It has been yanked from
  PyPi. The issue is fixed in v0.4.1.

* Update Grism model to use correct definition of dispersion, accomodate
  trace and dispersion models with polynomial order > 1
* Establish coordinate system `#12`_
* Fix direction and orientation of Tilt `#12`_
* Allow spectral inputs to radiometry.path_emission

.. _#12: https://github.com/andykee/lentil/issues/12

* Fix implementation error in Gaussian detector.shot_noise
* Add better exception handling for detector.shot_noise `#10`_
* No longer check Python version on import

v0.3.3
------
Released August 17, 2020

* Make FPN seed optional in ``detector.dark_current``

v0.3.2
------
Released July 20, 2020

* Update ``detector.adc`` to prevent negative values from being returned.

v0.3.1
------
Released July 16, 2020

* Imaging artifact classes have been rearchitected as functions.
* Legacy functionality from the ``detector.Windowable`` class has been resurrected into
  :func:`lentil.util.window`
* Deprecate ``util.col_major_to_util_major()``
* Lentil is now compatible with Python 3.6 and newer. `#9`_

.. _#9: https://github.com/andykee/lentil/issues/9

v0.3.0
------
Released July 8, 2020

* The Plane attribute caching approach has been entirely reworked, eliminating the need
  for end-users to explicitly decorate attributes defined in subclasses:

  * Users are now able to explicitly choose which attributes are cached when
    ``cache_propagate()`` is called by specifying them in ``Plane.cache_attrs``. The
    only accepted values right now are ``amplitude`` and ``phase``. Note that
    ``ptt_vector`` is always cached and is not allowed to be specified in
    ``cache_attrs``.

  * Rather than checking for and returning cached values at the attribute getter level,
    it is now done inside ``Plane.multiply()``. This change streamlines both the plane
    attribute getter code and the creation of planes with phase attributes that should
    be random with each access.

  * The ``cache_propagate`` decorator has been deprecated, and the documentation and
    tests have been updated to reflect the changes in functionality. `#7`_

* Fix bug in ``zernike_coordinates`` that was causing modes over off-centered masks to
  be incorrectly computed. `#8`_
* Change default behavior of ``zernike_basis`` to return a stack of matrices rather than
  a single vectorized matrix.

v0.2.0
------
Released June 29, 2020

* Collapse ``Detector`` and ``Image`` planes into single ``Image`` plane. The pupil to
  image plane propagation method is now chosen based on whether the ``Image`` plane has
  a defined ``pixelscale`` (propagate via matrix triple product DFT) or if
  ``pixelscale`` is None (propagate via FFT - eventually). ``Detector`` class has been
  deprecated. `#5`_
* Deprecate ``FPA`` and ``BayerFPA``. Some functionality has been retained but converted
  to atomic functions in the :ref:`detector<api.detector>` module. `#6`_
* Completely rework the contents of the :ref:`detector<api.detector>` module. All
  objects have been deprecated. Some functionality has been retained but converted to
  atomic functions instead. `#6`_
* Deprecate ``util.coordinates``
* Change the way ``Rotate`` angle is interpreted to behave more intuitively
* A number of small bugfixes and enhancements
* Updated documentation
* More unit tests
